# [](#header-2)About
I am a Master's student in Data Science at [New York University](http://cds.nyu.edu/). Prior to that I received my degree in Electrical Engineering from [Universidad Catolica Argentina](http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/facultad-de-ciencias-fisicomatematicas-e-ingenieria/). 

My main interests are in neural language models, and generative models more broadly. Also interested in adversarial and reinforcement learning. 

#  [](#header-2)Courses
Some interesting courses I have taken:

- Natural Language Understanding with Deep Learning

- Inference and Representation

- Machine Learning and Computational Statistics

- Deep Learning
