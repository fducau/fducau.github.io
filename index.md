# [](#header-2)About
I am a machine learning researcher and engineer who specializes in the design and evaluation of deep learning models. As part of Sophos Data Science team, I currently focus on the development of deep learning applications for cybersecurity. I received my Master's degree in Data Science at the [Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University where I focused my research on adversarial learning applied to generative models. Prior to that I received my degree in Electrical Engineering from [Universidad Catolica Argentina](http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/facultad-de-ciencias-fisicomatematicas-e-ingenieria/). 

My main interests are in neural language models, and generative models more broadly, adversarial and reinforcement learning. Also, I'm currently exploring ways in which ML can be used to help improve the way we grow food.
