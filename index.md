# [](#header-2)About
I am a machine learning researcher and engineer how specializes in the design and evaluation of deep learning models. As part of Sophos Data Science team, I currently focus on the development of deep learning applications for cybersecurity. I received my Master's degree in Data Science at the [Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University where I focused on adversarial learning applied to generative models. Prior to that I received my degree in Electrical Engineering from [Universidad Catolica Argentina](http://www.uca.edu.ar/index.php/site/index/es/uca/facultad-de-ciencias-fisicomatematicas-e-ingenieria/). 

My main interests are in neural language models, and generative models more broadly. Also interested in adversarial and reinforcement learning.
